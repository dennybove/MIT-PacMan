This simple JavaScript exercise demonstrates the ability to manipulate objects inside of an HTML file. This project aims to recreate the classic aracde game, Pac-Man using simply Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 

## Installation

Download the repository and open locally in the DOM of your choice.

## Description
This project demonstrates simple edge detection using the current window size. On load, PacMan begins across the page. When the edge of the page is detected, PacMan then flips direction and begins going the opposite way.

## Road Map
At the start of this course, this program simply loops back and forth indefinitely. As the course continues, I plan to update and flesh out a fully functional PacMan game. Fully playable in the DOM.
